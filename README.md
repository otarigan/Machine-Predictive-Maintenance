## Introduction:
In industrial operations, the reliability and availability of machines are vital for continued production and profitability. To achieve this, maintenance work is completed to allow machines to remain operating under their defined constraints, extending the machine’s remaining useful life (RUL). Ranging from visual inspections, routine maintenance, and equipment calibrations, maintenance is a substantial part of any industrial operation. For various industries around the world, maintenance costs can be upwards of 15% - 60% of the cost of goods produced [1]. This is a substantial amount of investment for operations, and it is in the facility’s best interest to drive down maintenance costs. Some maintenance surveys carried out by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) indicate that one-third of all maintenance-related costs are wasted due to “unnecessary or improperly carried out maintenance” practices [1]. Therefore, maintenance optimization in terms of lowered costs and sustaining high reliability are major objectives of many industrial operations [2].
